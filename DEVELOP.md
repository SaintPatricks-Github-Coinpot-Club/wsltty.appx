## Requirements

* [Windows 10 SDK]
* [VS Build Tools]

Download only MSBuildTools Workload (for .NET framework) with this command: `vs_BuildTools.exe --layout C:\BuildTools --add Microsoft.VisualStudio.Workload.MSBuildTools --lang en-US`. This will create a offline installer of MSBuild in `C:\BuildTools` folder. This requires to compile Launcher executable only.

Windows SDK tools can be found in `%ProgramFiles(x86)%\Windows Kits\10\bin\10.0.16299.0\x64\` folder. MSBuild Tools can be found in `%ProgramFiles(x86)%\Microsoft Visual Studio\2017\BuildTools\MSBuild\15.0\Bin\` folder. These are the default folder and may be changed if you install SDK and Build Tools of different versions and in different folder.

## Project Overview

* Assets: All the PNG images for start menu tiles and taskbar icons. Splash and wide images are not added as those distort the Tux image.
* Launcher: C# source code and project file for Launcher to launch `mintty` with proper arguments.
* AppxManifest.xml: This XML file contains information the system needs to deploy, display, or update a Universal Windows Platform (UWP) app. This info includes package identity, package dependencies, required capabilities, visual elements, and extensibility points.
* NewTux.svg: A SVG image to create all the Assets and wsltty.ico file. Source: https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:NewTux.svg and Based on original image by Larry Ewing, made in GIMP. Attribution: lewing@isc.tamu.edu Larry Ewing and The GIMP.
* resource.pri.xml: A XML file to create PRI file with `MakePri.exe` command line tool. A PRI file is an index of application resources (i.e. strings, files, etc). This file is generated with `MakePri.exe createconfig` command.
* resources.pri_dump.xml: A XML file is created (or dumped) after making resources.pri file. This does not require for building process. One can dump this XML file from PRI file with `MakePri.exe dump` command and compare that to check if anything is missing or changed.
* wsltty.ico: An icon file for mintty window.

## Customization

* Change tile background color: Change the hex value of `BackgroundColor` attribute of `uap:VisualElements` tag in AppxManifest.xml file. Find more HEX color code at [W3Schools Colors Hexadecimal].
* Change wsltty.ico file: The wsltty.ico was made using GIMP from [NewTux.SVG]. Make 16px, 24px, 32px, 48px, 128px and 256px sizes .PNG files and combine them into .ICO file using GIMP.
* Change Assets: Change any image in Assets folder. Just make sure to name the .PNG file according to the previous file and maintain it's resolution.
* Change locale: Replace `en-US` in `resources.pri.xml` and `AppxManifest.xml` file with your own locale. e.g. `en-GB` for UK, `fr-FR` for France, `el-GR` for Greek etc.

## How to build

* Clone this GitHub repository with `git clone https://github.com/mintty/wsltty.appx.git` and open command prompt in the clone directory.

* Run the script `build.cmd` (Windows) or `build.sh` (cygwin) to build the appx package, or follow the manual steps listed below:

* Make a folder (e.g. `build`), copy `AppxManifest.xml` file and `Assets` folder (with all PNG images) in that folder.

* Create a configuration file (e.g. `resources.pri.xml`):
    `MakePri createconfig /cf resources.pri.xml /dq en-US /pv 10.0.0`

* Remove these lines from that XML file:

```xml
<packaging>
    <autoResourcePackage qualifier="Language"/>
    <autoResourcePackage qualifier="Scale"/>
    <autoResourcePackage qualifier="DXFeatureLevel"/>
</packaging>
```

* Make resources.pri:
    `MakePri.exe new /pr build /cf resources.pri.xml /mn build\AppXManifest.xml /of build\resources.pri`

* Build Launcher:
    `msbuild.exe /nologo /verbosity:minimal Launcher\Launcher.csproj`

* Copy `Launcher.exe` and `Launcher.exe.config` files in `build\bin` folder. Then copy language and theme files and make `charnames.txt` from mintty repository. Place all the required executables and required user files in build folder as follows:

```
build\
|
+---AppxManifest.xml
+---resources.pri
|
+---Assets\ (all .png files)
|
+---bin\
|   |
|   +---cygwin-console-helper.exe
|   +---cygwin1.dll
|   +---Launcher.exe
|   +---Launcher.exe.config
|   +---mintty.exe
|   +---wslbridge-backend
|   +---wslbridge.exe
|   +---wsltty.ico
|
+---usr\
    |
    +---share\
        |
        +---mintty\
            |
            |---info\
            |   |
            |   +---charnames.txt
            |
            +---lang\ (all .po files)
            |
            +---themes\ (all themes)
            |
            +---sounds\ (all bell sounds)
```

* Make Appx package:
     `MakeAppx.exe pack /l /d build /p wsltty.appx`

* Make certificate:
    `MakeCert -sv privatekeyfile.pvk -n "CN=mintty" certfile.cer -b mm/dd/yyyy -e mm/dd/yyyy -r`

* Make PFX:
    `PVK2PFX –pvk privatekeyfile.pvk –spc certfile.cer –pfx pfxfile.pfx –po yourpfxpassword`

* Sign Appx:
    `SignTool.exe sign /fd sha256 /a /f pfxfile.pfx /p yourpfxpassword wsltty.appx`

* Install Certificate:  Double click on `certfile.cer` file > Click on "Install Certificate" > Choose "Local Machine" > Choose "Place Certificate in the following store" > Click on "Browse" > Scroll down and choose only "Trusted People". The file name, `certfile.cer` can be changed. Alternatively, install certificate with this command as administrator:
        certutil -addstore TrustedPeople certfile.cer
